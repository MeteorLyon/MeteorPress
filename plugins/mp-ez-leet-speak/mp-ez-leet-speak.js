/**
 *
 * This is where lazy plugins go.  Lazy plugins ignore all of MP existing
 * file architecture and and use isClient/isServer/etc and can have any
 * structure it wants to as long as it's files reside within it's own
 * subdirectory.  Meteor will load these files naturally, and MP will
 * mostly ignore them.
 *
 * This plugin would call hooks (yet to be designed) for text post-processing
 * which makes simple substitutions to turn all your content into hax0r talk.
 *
 * It could easily be used as a template for building a sexy automatic
 * translator using Google APIs or something... *hint*hint*
